# VariableLight
The variable light project is meant to help us learn CAD design skills for the group project. The task here was to build a light that needed to follow the following constraints: must be small, light, have 5 modes, have a modular battery, and survive a 3ft drop test; that is tremendously simplified, but highlights the gist of what needed to be done. The final product is shown below and specs can be found in each of the respective folders.
